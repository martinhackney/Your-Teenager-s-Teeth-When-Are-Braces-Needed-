        <p>Being the parent of a teenager can be tough.  But as the adult, it&amp;rsquo;s your (sometimes thankless!) job to do what you can to take care of your teen&amp;rsquo;s health. Understanding when and why your teenager needs to get braces is a part of that. In this post, you will learn the signals to look for.</p>

<h2>They Have Crowding</h2>

<p>This is exactly what it sounds like &amp;mdash; there isn&amp;rsquo;t enough space in their mouths for all of their teeth. If crowding isn&amp;rsquo;t caught early enough, it can lead to crooked teeth that will take much longer to straighten.  Plus, it also makes hygiene, especially flossing, more of a challenge. To make sure your teen can properly care for their teeth, it&amp;rsquo;s time for braces.</p>

<h2>They Have An Overbite</h2>

<p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that your teen&amp;rsquo;s front teeth seem to be sticking out much more than the bottom row of their teeth, it&amp;rsquo;s likely that they have an overbite. This is fairly common, but it comes with a host of health problems you&amp;rsquo;ll need to be aware of. They&amp;rsquo;re much more likely to chip their front teeth, especially if they take a fall or suffer another injury. Over time, an untreated overbite can also lead to a necessity for serious dental surgery &amp;mdash; both cosmetic and developmental. This is because it causes the jaw to grow asymmetrically. </p>

<h2>They Have An Underbite</h2>

<p>You can recognize this because you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that all of your teen&amp;rsquo;s upper teeth are hidden by the lower teeth. It&amp;rsquo;s caused when by an imbalance in jaw alignment and size. You need to treat it, as it can make it hard to chew food.  If your teen claims they &amp;ldquo;can&amp;rsquo;t deal&amp;rdquo; with how braces will look, just tell them this fact: an untreated underbite has been known to cause premature aging and even a somewhat lopsided facial look! </p>

<h2>When They Ask for Them</h2>

<p>Sometimes,when trying to figure out whether or not the braces teens wear are the right option for your child, you just have to talk to them. While you&amp;rsquo;re concerned about the orthodontic health and support that braces provide, it&amp;rsquo;s far more likely that your teen has the cosmetic reasons for braces in mind. If your child is getting made fun of because of their teeth, of if they&amp;rsquo;re just feeling insecure about how they took, it might be time to broach the topic with them.  Remind your child that if braces make them feel self-conscious &amp;mdash; and 1 out of 2 teens say they do &amp;mdash; that they&amp;rsquo;re not alone. In fact, over 4 million Americans under the age of 18 currently wear braces.  Braces are just something that most everyone has to wear &amp;mdash; and they can even have a lot of fun picking out different band colors to match their favorite sports team or band.</p>

<h2>Is Your Teen Ready for Braces?</h2>

<p>Thanks to this post, you now have a much better understanding of the signals you need to look out for when it comes to your teenager&amp;rsquo;s teeth.  Getting your teenager to smile is already a challenge &amp;mdash; let braces do at least some of the work for you.</p>
